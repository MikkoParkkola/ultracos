# UltraCoS — token-savings codec for Claude Code

UltraCoS is a Claude Code plugin that compresses tool-result output before it
enters the model's context, cutting token cost with no change to what the agent
can see. It is **lossless by default**, **fail-open** (any error passes the
original output through untouched), and runs as a prebuilt native binary on the
hot path with a Python fallback.

## What it does

On every tool result, UltraCoS applies safe, reversible-in-meaning transforms:

- **ANSI strip · JSON minify · blank-collapse · trailing-whitespace trim** —
  mechanical, lossless cleanups.
- **Shape-aware compaction** — JSON, YAML/TOML, code, and filesystem path-lists
  each get the transform that suits them; path-lists are folded by common prefix.
- **Oversize truncation with an anchor-survival guard** — large outputs are
  tail-trimmed, but a compression that would drop the one `file:line` or error
  code that made the output useful is automatically reverted.
- **Session dedup** — a repeated `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` result is replaced with a
  short reference to its earlier occurrence.
- **Break-even gating** — compaction only applies when it actually saves enough
  tokens to be worth a schema tag.

Everything is gated so the codec can reduce tokens but never corrupt an agent's
context.

## Install

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add MikkoParkkola/ultracos
claude plugin install ultracos
```

Hooks fire automatically on the next session. Inspect savings with the
`ultracos-stats` command.

## The Rust hot path

The codec ships as prebuilt binaries under [`bin/<triple>/`](bin/) (macOS and
Linux, arm64 and x86_64) and runs by default — roughly `5 ms` versus `~170 ms`
for the Python interpreter, with identical compression. The Python codec is the
portable fallback (unsupported platform, missing binary, `ULTRACOS_RUST=0`).
Every path is fail-open. Binaries are reproducible from the in-repo source via
[`bin/build.sh`](bin/build.sh) and verified by `bin/SHA256SUMS`.

See [`ultracos-core/`](ultracos-core/) for the codec source — it is fully open;
read every line. Configuration lives in the env-var table inside the codec docs.

## Calibration — a published snapshot, kept current as a service

The codec's keep-vs-compress boundary depends on a token estimate. UltraCoS ships
a **calibration snapshot**: a small data file of per-model `tokens-per-char`
values. Those values are fitted from real, model-billed token counts, so the
estimate matches a model's actual tokenizer rather than a fixed assumption. The
fallback, when no snapshot value applies, is the classic 4-characters-per-token
estimate.

### What is public vs what is not

| Public (in this repo) | Private (not shared) |
|---|---|
| The codec source — every line, inspectable. | The learning loop that produces snapshots. |
| The published calibration snapshot — the numbers, the schema, and the version. | The data, the method, and the fitting pipeline that generate those numbers. |

You can read, run, fork, and audit everything here. The snapshot is a **result you
can use**; reproducing it would require the private loop, which is not part of this
repository.

### It is a snapshot, and it is a service

A model's tokenizer can change with a model update, and no changelog is published
when it does. This snapshot is therefore **refreshed when a model's tokenizer
changes** — that is the service. A frozen copy keeps working under the license,
but it stops tracking changes after the tokenizer moves; a refreshed snapshot
tracks it.

Every value in a published snapshot is fitted from measured token counts. The
project does not publish performance or savings claims it has not measured.
